    #1441JS_FOR_FRONT_END : TODO : inc
    CSS is very incomplete on its own. it provides a lot of desktop solutions, but most of the time we need js to manupulate it
    for something meaningful. there is a lot of stupidity going around. 
    for eg, a site could work perfetly in fullscreen, showin all its navbar items, and a hovering menu when needed. but in smaller 
    screens where all items cannot be shown and a navigation hamburger menu is needed, css would fail to provide a complete solution, 
    as it does not have a :click{} solution by default(* there are some hacks to it checkout: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32721572/7500651)

    in css, the interactivity is handled at a very lower level which is weird. either handle it full or leave it completely for the js.
    not going into details, but here is a list of interaction that i know and weather it is or isn't handled by css:
    
    - interaction between the app/website and hand(touch): implemented weirdly. if the element clicked has a script attached to its action/onclick,
        the script will run. exception : A tag/img, which has a default nature to open the link attached to it.
    - mouse click: todo
    - mouse hover..., keyboard input a probably hand hover(via soli chip technology))
