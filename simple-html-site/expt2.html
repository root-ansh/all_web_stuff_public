<h1> The Indian National flag.</h1>
<div class="container">
    A number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian Independence Movement by the
    rulers of different princely states; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of
    India after the rebellion of 1857, which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. The first flag,
    whose design was based on western heraldic standards, were similar to the flags of other British colonies, including
    Canada and South Africa; its red field included the Union Flag in the upper-left quadrant and a Star of India capped
    by the royal crown in the middle of the right half. To address the question of how the star conveyed "Indianness",
    Queen Victoria created the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India to honour services to the empire by
    her Indian subjects. Subsequently, all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic
    criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.[10][11][12]

    Flag of British India, 1880â€“1947
    In the early twentieth century, around the coronation of Edward VII, a discussion started on the need for a heraldic
    symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil
    Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common
    choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it
    for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags.[13] Around this time, nationalist opinion within the
    realm was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the
    Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.
    Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not
    suggest unity with India's Muslim population.[14]

    Based on the Calcutta Flag, design of the "Flag of Indian Independence" raised by Bhikaji Cama on 22 August 1907, at
    the International Socialist Conference in Stuttgart, Germany.
    The partition of Bengal (1905) resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence
    movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The Vande Mataram flag, part of
    the Swadeshi movement against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic
    fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a
    sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The
    flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag
    was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the annual session of the
    Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second
    International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate
    enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.[15]
    <br><br>

    Around the same time, another proposal for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple
    of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the
    border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National
    Congress meeting in 1906.[16] Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the
    nationalist movement.
    <br><br>

    In 1909, Lord Ampthill, former Governor of the Madras Presidency, wrote to The Times of London in the run up to
    Empire Day pointing out that there existed "no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province...
    Surely this is strange, seeing that but for India there would be no Empire."[17]
    <br><br>
    In 1916, Pingali Venkayya submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court
    of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same
    year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included
    the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed
    diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in
    the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The
    ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.[18]
